This repository contains examples of common VBScript bugs related to late binding and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.vbs` file demonstrates the issues, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides corrected code.  Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to runtime errors if the object or method doesn't exist. Implicit type conversion, where VBScript attempts to convert data types automatically, can produce unexpected results.  The solution emphasizes early binding and explicit type checking to avoid these issues.
